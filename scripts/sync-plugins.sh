# Vendor the shared Unicity AOS plugin scripts from plugins/common/bin into host
# plugins that mirror it, so each host plugin is SELF-CONTAINED.
#
# Why this exists: a plugin marketplace packages ONLY a single plugin's source
# directory (the marketplace manifest declares e.g. `source: ./plugins/claude`).
# A script under plugins/claude/bin therefore cannot reach a sibling
# plugins/common/ at runtime -- that path does not exist in the installed plugin
# cache. A thin wrapper that exec's `../../common/bin/aos-up` dies on launch
# with "No such file or directory", so the MCP stdio server never comes up and
# the host reports `-32000 failed to reconnect`.
#
# plugins/common/bin is the single source of truth. This materializes it into
# each mirroring host's bin/ as a regular file. Run it after editing anything in
# plugins/common/bin; CI verifies the committed copies have not drifted.
#
# Codex keeps its own entrypoint, doctor, and resolver. It shares only the
# idempotent host-pack installer.
